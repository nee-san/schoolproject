# Welcome to Ataraxia Linux 

## Introduction
Ataraxia Linux is an efficient, optimized and compact [Linux](https://www.kernel.org/) distribution which uses [musl libc](http://www.musl-libc.org/). It is an independent distribution, which uses its own fork of "pkgutils" from [CRUX](https://crux.nu/) for package management. Ataraxia Linux is a general-use distribution oriented towards advanced Linux users. Ataraxia Linux was compiled with a hardened toolchain for better security and uses the LTS Linux Kernel. This is a rolling-release distribution, allowing you to use the latest software. We have pretty good hardware support.
